# SoundCloud+

**SoundCloud+ is discontinued!**
As of 08/12/2013 this extension is obsolete since SoundCloud [announced](https://plus.google.com/+SoundCloud/posts/RP4ygwyWtsL) a native integration on Google+.

SoundCloud+ is a Google Chrome extension that improves
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/) integration on
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/) by embedding the SoundCloud player below links
to SoundCloud tracks.
