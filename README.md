SoundCloud+
===========

SoundCloud+ is a Google Chrome extension that improves the
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/) integration in [Google+](https://plus.google.com/)
by embedding the SoundCloud player below links to SoundCloud tracks.

TODOs
-----

* Instead of constantly querying for new Google+ posts / changes on the site find a way to be notified of changes
* Configuration options: Show/hide comments, color, HTML5 player
